                <h4>The Woman Who Outruns the Men, 200 Miles at a Time</h4>

                <p>
                    Courtney Dauwalter specializes in extremely long races. But her success in winning them has opened a
                    debate about how men’s innate strength advantages apply to endurance sports.

                    She saw live puppets playing on a swing set on the side of the trail. Trees and rocks turned into
                    faces. She was on her second night without sleep, 165 miles into a 205-mile race through the
                    mountains, pushing her body to levels considered physically impossible not long ago, and seeing very
                    strange things in the night.

                <h4>V.A.R. at the Women’s World Cup? FIFA Still Won’t Say</h4>

                <p>
                    PARIS — As the men’s World Cup was winding down last summer in Russia, FIFA’s president, Gianni
                    Infantino, used his final news conference to heap praise on the video assistant referee system,
                    which had been used for the first time at the tournament. It had become, Infantino declared,
                    “difficult to think about the World Cup without V.A.R.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    It remains to be seen whether Infantino was referring only to the men’s game when he essentially
                    called the technology indispensable. To the dismay of some top players and coaches in the women’s
                    game, FIFA, the governing body of
                    international soccer, has not confirmed whether V.A.R. will be used at the Women’s World Cup next
                    summer in France.

                <h4>The Best Music Videos of 2018</h4>

                <p>
                    In 2018, music videos can still be the most powerful way for an artist to introduce us to their
                    creative world, unveil a new aesthetic, or offer an emotional short story. This year saw newcomers
                    like Tierra Whack and Rosalía astound with their ambitious visions.

                    Beyoncé, JAY-Z, and Childish Gambino used videos to make bold political statements that instantly
                    went viral. And LCD Soundsystem and Hurray for the Riff Raff gave us beautifully shot and acted
                    mini-movies. These bursts of sound and image are readily accessible, mercifully brief, and, at their
                    best, a lot more fulfilling than mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Here are our 25 favorites
                    from this year.

                <h4>In Sight Out: Liz Phair</h4>

                <p>
                    Emerging from the indie-rock boys club of Chicago in the early 1990s, Liz Phair made her name with
                    her 1993 masterpiece Exile in Guyville, a song-by-song response to the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main
                    Street.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made her a star. This year, to celebrate Exile in Guyville’s 25th anniversary, Phair’s label
                    Matador released Girly-Sound to Guyville, a collection of the home-recorded tapes that she made
                    leading up to Guyville which offer a detailed look at the process and genius behind a feminist rock
                    classic.
