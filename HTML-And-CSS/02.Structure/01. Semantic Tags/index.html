        <h1>I washed my face with sparkling water for a week</h1>

        When I gave birth in early September, I knew it would change my life. What I wasn’t aware of, though, was just
        how much it would transform me and my daily life in every single way.

            Tending to my crying babe takes precedence over looking in the mirror. 30-minute showers have become swift
            splashes. Makeup doesn’t matter nearly as much. My skin care routine is less of a routine and more of an
            infrequent luxury.

            Many people believe that using carbonated water to wash your face can help improve appearance of the skin.
